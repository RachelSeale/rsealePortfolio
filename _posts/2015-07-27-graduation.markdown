Today was the day that I have been looking forward to for the past four years. 

Graduation. 

After all the hard work, I am proud to say I graduated with a first honours degree in Digital Media BA Hons.

It has been the best experience of my life, I meet and made so many great friends, and I couldn't of done it without them.


I have learnâ€™t so much about myself and my degree and now I cannot wait to begin my journey within the Digital industry. I am going to take everything heads on that comes my way and enjoy every minute.
