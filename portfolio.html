					<h2>Oasis Fashion - International</h2>
					<p>I was able to work part time at Oasis Fashion during my final year. Part of my role was to code up the weekly emails for 7 different countries and update the site with new content. I was also asked to make the international site up to date with the UK. So I re-designed the navigation, footer and product pages to look like the UK, as before they where very outdated. (Examples to come)</p>
